Program to calculate transactions between friends after multiple events attended.

1. Input names & payment methods for all friends present
2. Input event names, total cost (& individual cost if values are not equal), and who paid for the event.
3. Get in return calculated values of how much each person owes someone else.

Future directions (29/12/25):
